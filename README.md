Halo1 Tool++

Source code to the GUI wrapper of Halo1's Tool command line app. Originally released to the public in 2004 http://hce.halomaps.org/index.cfm?fid=578

This is a straight copy of the source code as it appeared on an old HDD. I have not tested it tried recompiling it with modern technology.

# Old notes

Tool++ is a full GUI wrapper for tool.exe. It also has a default selection feature that allows you to select which command you want to goto first when you start up. And it also outputs everything to a editbox that tool.exe spits out, and also hides tool so you don't have as much clutter. The tool output editbox only gets updated when the command completes currently; but I am trying to make it update everything when there's new text to be shown. I hope this helps as much as HaloAnimationEditor does
